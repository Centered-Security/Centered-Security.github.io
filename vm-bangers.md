 [Verse]
Zero day alert
Patches on the way
We dive deep in the code
Not a second to delay

[Verse 2]
In the server room
Lights are flashing bright
Systems on the brink
We work through the night

[Chorus]
Zero day zero fucks
We patch it up no luck
Fighting bugs all around
We won’t let them bring us down

[Verse 3]
Paycom team is strong
We’re the vanguard line
Vulnerabilities won’t stay
Our patching’s just in time

[Verse 4]
Scripts and tools in hand
We make systems safe
Against the hackers' plans
We’re the ones they can't enslave

[Chorus]
Zero day zero fucks
We patch it up no luck
Fighting bugs all around
We won’t let them bring us down
