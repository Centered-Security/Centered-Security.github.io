 <summary>Zero Day, Zero Fucks Lyrics</summary>
<p> [Verse]
Zero day alert
Patches on the way
We dive deep in the code
Not a second to delay
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
In the server room
Lights are flashing bright
Systems on the brink
We work through the night
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Zero day zero fucks
We patch it up no luck
Fighting bugs all around
We won’t let them bring us down
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Paycom team is strong
We’re the vanguard line
Vulnerabilities won’t stay
Our patching’s just in time
</p>
<p>
[Verse 4]
Scripts and tools in hand
We make systems safe
Against the hackers' plans
We’re the ones they can't enslave
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Zero day zero fucks
We patch it up no luck
Fighting bugs all around
We won’t let them bring us down
</p>

 <summary>Vulnerability, Sensibility Lyrics</summary>
<p> 
[Verse]
Digging deep in the dark back alleys
Nerves wired with caffeine and chaos
Chasing shadows in the haunted valley
Systems moaning like a prowling boss
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
Lines of code like a tangled noose
Whispers of deception in the firmware bloom
Unseen enemies dance and seduce
Paycom's guardians tracking the gloom
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Vulnerability sensibility
Spotlight shining on the silent screams
Vulnerability responsibility
In the labyrinth of broken dreams
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Patch the holes in a crumbling wall
Wounds bleeding in the midnight crawl
Data slip through and the alarms call
Fight the ghosts that haunt the protocol
</p>
<p>
[Verse 4]
Audit trails like a spider's web
Scavengers feed on security's dread
Eyes wide open in the analyst's head
Hunting monsters beneath the bed
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
Unmask the phantoms lurking
In the spaces where trust is fraying
A dance with digital demons
Hear the cries of the betrayed praying
</p>
 </details>

 <summary>Tenable so Expendable Lyrics</summary>
<p> 
[Verse]
We had a tool so strong
Tenable was our song
Now it's just a buzz
Lost our faith because
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
Reports used to shine bright
Tenable in the spotlight
Now we feel betrayed
Security starts to fade
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Tenable Tenable
Once so defendable
Tenable Tenable
Now just expendable
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Scanning every night
Trying to win the fight
But the love is gone
Tenable's old dawn
</p>
<p>
[Verse 4]
Alerts keep coming in
Feels like we can't win
Tenable's lost its charm
No longer keeps us warm
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Tenable Tenable
Once so defendable
Tenable Tenable
Now just expendable
</p>

 <summary>P. Y. S. Lyrics</summary>
<p> 
[Verse 1]
Vuln team in the lab, code's leaking, it's tragic,
Patching servers quick, like sorcerers, it's magic,
Systems felt the crack, now we seal it up right,
Knights in digital armor, we wage the good fight.
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Patch yo shit, keep the servers legit,
No more downtime, no hacker's hit,
Secure the fortress, every byte, every bit,
Patch yo shit, keep the systems lit.
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
Paycom squad, on the grind, we fix it, we flex,
Eyes on the logs, catch the bugs like we Hex,
No bypass, no crash, can't hack the nexus,
Spyware and malware, out the door, we lexus.
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
Scripts running smooth, automate the fix,
Zero-day threats, we toss 'em in the mix,
Firewall's strong, we ain't playing no tricks,
Digital soldiers, server security we affix.
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Patch yo shit, keep the servers legit,
No more downtime, no hacker's hit,
Secure the fortress, every byte, every bit,
Patch yo shit, keep the systems lit.
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Firmware updated, our protocol tight,
Vulnerabilities detected, we setting ‘em right,
No wack lines of code gonna ruin our sight,
Every patch: precise, disciplined, precise.
</p>

 <summary>Riskin it all 4 u Lyrics</summary>
<p> 
[Verse]
Late night screens glow
Servers running slow
Security on the line
Teams decline
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
Emails sent again
Ignoring the chain
Patching left behind
Outdated kind
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
We’re riskin' it all for you
While others seem to fall through
They don’t see the warning signs
We’re riskin' it all for you
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Vulnerable machines
Out of date scenes
Threats lurk in the dark
Leaving their mark
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
Patch it up patch it now
Don’t know why they won't allow
Chasing bugs fixing holes
Always keeping our goals
</p>
<p>
[Verse 4]
Holding tight our post
Others miss the most
Calling for change that’s due
We’re riskin' it all for you
</p>

 <summary>Unsafe and Unfazed Lyrics</summary>
<p> 
[Verse]
Servers still open doors wide
Vuln team sent warnings high tide
Patches handed out like gold
But no one's doing as they're told
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
Chasing down the ghost of change
Emails sent but none arranged
We tried and tried to patch the holes
But they're as stubborn as a mule
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
So we go drinking yeah
Unsafe and unfazed no care
Servers still bare and exposed
We'll toast to those who never closed
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
In a bar with neon lights
Laughing through the sleepless nights
Shouting loud we'll be alright
Forgetting all that patching strife
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Cowboy hats and worn-out boots
We trade our jobs for country roots
We gave our all to make them safe
But now we dance and misbehave
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
So we go drinking yeah
Unsafe and unfazed no care
Servers still bare and exposed
We'll toast to those who never closed
</p>

Paycom team we stand so tall
Vulnerable we've patched them all
Cold-hearted colchado's heart
Breaking as we drift apart

New York calls his name out loud
Leaving us here feeling proud
Leader strong in every way
But this hurts too much to say
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Cold-hearted colchado
Leaving for a new tomorrow
Paycom team our pride will follow
But our hearts are full of sorrow
</p>
<p>
[Verse 3]
Every breach we stood and fought
Lessons that you always taught
Tales of cyber worlds so far
Guiding us just like a star
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
Cold winds of the city blow
Colchado must now freely go
But we'll keep the flame alive
Paycom strong we'll always strive
</p>
<p>
Chorus]
Cold-hearted colchado
Leaving for a new tomorrow
Paycom team our pride will follow
But our hearts are full of sorrow

Guarding servers with all our might
Paycom warriors feeling strong
Hackers creeping nothing's wrong

Battling shadows in the moonlight
Data safe lines holding firm

Hackers fall and we stand tall
Logging in the key of E

Waging war on digital knights
No surrender no retreat
Victory in every beat
</p>

Lines of code like battle cries
Seeing danger through our eyes
Paycom army steady stay
Hackers falling in dismay
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
Logging in the key of E
Paycom fighting fearlessly
Hackers fall and we stand tall
Logging in the key of E
